Overall picture of travelers' planning status in an all encompassing view: a kanban board type lists with each card under a list being a traveler

Detailed version:

Stages, lists and cards

- A traveler's planning status has multiple stages: Onboarding, Education, Plan done, Hotels done, etc.
- The view should be a trello like board, with each list (column) being one of the stages and each card under a list being the traveler
- Knowing how many and which travelers are under each stage is paramount for the business to function effectively so all travelers in the same stage should appear under the same list as cards
